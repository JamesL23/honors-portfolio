<h4>Finding My People</h4>
<p>
    My first few days at UW were overwhelming; I met more new people in about a week than I had in the past several years. I was rather disappointed that I hadn't found anyone to play my favorite video game with though. I had been easily able to find other people at UW to play other versions of Super Smash Bros. with, but I hadn't run into anyone who really seemed interested in improving at the game, and I also hadn't found a single person was into Project M (or Project+, the more up-to-date successor to Project M), the same version I had played and come to love when I was in high school. Eventually, after asking around in a few large Discord servers, I was directed to Vy Nguyen, the current treasurer and Project+ tournament organizer at UW Smash, and later met him at UW Hub Crawl.
</p>

<p>
    A few weeks after that, I entered my first Project+ tournament at UW Smash. While I did manage to win one set, I soon realized I had a lot to learn still despite having already played with my friends for four years.
</p>
<h4>Getting involved</h4>
<p>
    After finding the club during my first quarter, I continued attending for the next few months until COVID showed up and quarantine happened. While some other local Super Smash Bros. continued to run events online, the demand within UW Smash wasn't enough for us to do the same, so the club went dormant for the next year and a half. As the return to in-person school in Autumn 2021 drew near, Vy reached out to me about taking over his previous position as a club officer, since he had graduated the prior spring, and so I started getting involved with handling the club's finances and running Project+ events. I also used this as an experiential learning activity during the first quarter I was involved, and I have included my reflection on that here:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Looking back on the quarter, I think most of my involvement with UW Smash ended up being within my expectations. We had a few hiccups early on in the quarter such as having to quickly adapt to some confusing UW HFS policy changes for COVID-19, but we as a team were able to sort out any issues that emerged, and our weekly meetings ran smoothly for the most part.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Working with UW Smash allowed me to provide more events and visibility for the Project+ community, which was one of my goals in taking on this position. Although I am still relatively new to the community, I feel very at home in it; at the end of the day, everybody in the community is here for the people, the game, or some combination of both. Project+ is not an eSport with any appreciable amount of money in it, and while that can certainly cause problems, I can appreciate a community that likes what they do. Working as the UW Smash treasurer and Project+ Tournament Organizer also served as a general confidence booster in that I was able to find something I wanted to do and find reasonable success. Typically the things I find success in are things I need to but don't necessarily want to do, and most of the things I do "for fun" end up falling apart due to lack of support or personal motivation, so I was glad to find a balance here.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    My contributions to UW Smash's success this quarter were managing the club's finances by collecting funds at events and purchasing some necessary equipment as well as assisting with general logistics by helping to schedule weekly events, advertising Project+ events to the local community, and transporting equipment.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    I intend to continue my work with UW Smash. UW Smash is planned to run through the remainder of the academic year, my responsibilities were manageable, and I enjoyed the work, so I would like to continue helping out.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    Going into the quarter, I was actually expecting my work with UW Smash to be more stressful. While the events were definitely hectic at times, there was never anything that was unmanageable, especially with the support I had from the other officers and community members. Working with UW Smash has made me more confident in my ability to adapt to new responsibilities, and also taught me that it can be OK to take things as they come. It is rare that everything will happen according to plan, so while it is good to prepare to the extent that is possible, there is no sense in worrying incessantly about what might or might not happen.

<h4>Picking up Melee</h4>
<p>
    Up until this point in time, I had pretty much exclusively played Project+, occasionally trying Melee (the main game at UW Smash) but then each time becoming frustrated with the stricter control scheme and dropping it. As a result, Vy was the only member of the club I had actually met (along with some members of the Greater Seattle Project+ scene that occasionally attended our tournaments), and since he had graduated the previous spring, I was left as the only Project+ player regularly attending the club. I did stubbornly continue playing the game by myself in the corner at first, but it felt strange to be an RSO officer without getting to know any of the RSO members very well. Plus, I soon also realized that playing with other people was really what made the games fun. Everyone else at the club played Melee, so it made sense for me to finally start learning the game in earnest.
</p>
<p>
    Super Smash Bros. Melee is an extremely technical game, which can make it extremely difficult to learn at first. On top of this, the differences between the two versions for Ganondorf, my main character in Project+, made him un-enjoyable for me to play in Melee, which meant I had to learn an entirely new character in a new game. I had a lot of trouble early on, being unable to do seemingly basic things such as run with my character, but with a bit of serious practice the game became more approachable, and I realized that many of the other newer players at my level were struggling with similar aspects of the game. Today, while I still consider myself a Project+ specialist, I am comfortable playing Melee as well, and have become better friends with the other UW Smash officers and club members.
