    Overview of my experience with honors
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>20Wi Honors 391 - Climate change</strong>:
        Climate change is an existential threat that affects us all, so I figured
        it might be good for me to know more about it. The course focused mainly on
        the existence of climate change and natural mechanisms responsible and the
        impracticality of solving climate change by taking individual actions. I wish
        my takeaway from the course could have been more hopeful, but it does seem like
        a situation that's hard to find hope in.

    <li>
        <strong>21Sp Honors 212 - Stories of Knowledge, Knowledge of Stories</strong>:
        I really enjoyed this course&#8212;it was the first non-CS course I had taken
        since spring quarter 2020 a year prior, so it felt like a very welcome breath
        of fresh air. One of the poems we read during the quarter,

            "Tiimiaq, something carried,"
        </a> by Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen, reminded me of the importance of language. Ojanen's
        discussion of reading "stumbling words" out of a dictionary <!-- TODO: What language was it? --> reminded me that it had been many, many years since I
        had last spoken Taiwanese Hokkien, a native language of my own.
