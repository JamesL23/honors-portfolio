    UW's Interdisciplinary Honors program provides a smaller community within the massive 
    population of UW&#8212;even if I didn't get to know everyone super well, it was nice to see 
    familiar faces in smaller classes rather than full lecture halls of complete strangers 
    quarter after quarter. It allowed me to explore a lot of topics that I might not have 
    gotten to learn about within my major or a traditional UW experience. Here are a few of my 
    favorites:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>20Wi - Climate Change: An International Perspective: Science, Art, and Activism - Dr. Robert Pavia</strong>:<br>
        Climate change is an existential threat that affects us all, so I figured
        it might be good for me to know more about it. The course focused mainly on
        the existence of climate change and natural mechanisms responsible and the
        impracticality of solving climate change by taking individual actions. I wish
        my takeaway from the course could have been more hopeful, but it does seem like
        a situation that's hard to find hope in.

        <strong>21Sp - Stories of Knowledge, Knowledge of Stories - Dr. Jeanette Bushnell</strong>:<br>
        I really enjoyed this course&#8212;it was the first non-CS course I had taken
        since spring quarter 2020 a year prior, so it felt like a very welcome breath
        of fresh air. One of the poems we read during the quarter,
        <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2020785205/">"Tiimiaq, something carried,"</a>
        by Carrie Ayagaduk Ojanen, reminded me of the importance of language. Ojanen's
        discussion of reading "stumbling words" out of an English/Inupiaq dictionary and
        the struggle of losing native languages reminded me of Taiwanese Hokkien, a
        neglected native language of my own. I could understand the language from having
        my parents and other fammily speak it around me, but I had stopped speaking it
        myself many, many years ago when I attended a summer camp in Taiwan and found
        that the other children had no idea what I was saying. I had been reflecting on 
        this, and decided to ask my parents to start speaking Taiwanese Hokkien with me 
        again, which they were happy to do. Here's a poem I wrote during the class about 
        my relationship to Taiwanese Hokkien:

        </p>
        <p style="margin:0">
            While not directly related to the content of the course and probably not even 
            intentional, Dr. Bushnell also nudged me towards a path of existential 
            thinking that eventually led to me taking various philosophy classes. After a 
            lecture, I asked if she had any preference for something small, like citation 
            styles for an assignment. In response, she remarked cheerfully, “It doesn't matter. 
            None of this matters.” While I assume my professor only meant to assure me not to 
            worry about details too much, I started thinking about the implications of scaling 
            that idea beyond that class&#8212;I probably wouldn't care later in life about my 
            grade on a single assignment or even my GPA, but then does <em>anything</em> really 
            matter given enough time? For now, I wouldn't consider myself a complete nihilist
            given that I have at least some desire to stay alive, but I also struggle to pin 
            down exactly what the meaning of life is, so the existential crisis remains 
            unresolved for now.

        <strong>22Au - Storytelling in the Sciences - Dr. Oliver Frasier</strong>:<br>
        This course was about presenting in general. Whether it's talking through a slide deck full of graphs and charts or re-telling an ancient myth, Dr. Frasier encouraged us to view all forms of presentation as storytelling. I've had a tendency to look at presentations as big, scary events in the past, so this new way of thinking will be really helpful moving forward.
        <br>
        Here's a brief presentation I gave during the class. It's about GameCube controllers and Super Smash Bros.
