<img src="docs/assets/artifacts/TerribleTerribleGradescopeScoresFrom312.png" alt="Terrible Gradescope scores from CSE 312" style="width:80%"><br>
Some terrible, terrible Gradescope assignment scores towards the end of Summer 2020. I wasn't adjusting to online classes well&#8212;I didn't pay attention in lectures, and I often would just not do most of my assignments.<br>
It was not a good time, and it didn't help that I was trying to also work on <a href="career.html">Ghost Pacer</a>. I ended up taking Fall 2020 off entirely because of how little I was enjoying online classes.

<img src="docs/assets/artifacts/runescape.png" alt="Old School Runescape character overview screenshot showing 38 days & 7 hours spent in game" style="width:50%"><br>
A screenshot of my Old School Runescape character overview. The game is mostly just about clicking on things while watching numbers go up, and I played entirely too much of it while taking online classes.<br>This screenshot is recent, but much of that playtime stat was achieved in 2020 and 2021 during online lectures.

<img src="docs/assets/artifacts/WingDomeAftermath.jpg" alt="Photo of me wearing Wing Dome 7 Alarm Challenge shirt after having completed the challenge" style="width:30%"><br>
A photo of me from Fall 2021, wearing Wing Dome's 7-Alarm Challenge shirt after finishing the challenge. One of my friends says I looked like an animal while I was eating, which makes sense because I don't have a lot of spice tolerance;<br>
I just went in there ready to eat all of the wings or die trying. I've never had an out-of-body experience outside of that challenge. It was a good time.

A video of me hitting a heavy squat PR at the end of Fall 2021. I'd enjoyed pushing my limits in the gym for a while before this, and that was a big milestone for me.<br>
I did burst a small blood vessel in my eye while hitting that PR and have dialed the intensity back a bit since, but I still enjoy working out.

<img src="docs/assets/artifacts/22GuitarPerformance.jpg" alt="Photo of me performing &quot;22&quot; by TaylorSwift with some housemates" style="width:30%"><br>
A photo from Fall 2022 of me and a few housemates performing "22" by Taylor Swift at a friend's 22nd birthday party.<br>
I started picking up the guitar in Fall 2021 when some of the people I had moved in with brought guitars, and it's been a lot of fun.
