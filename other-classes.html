<p>
    I probably could have made it through the past four years by taking classes only in the Computer Science and Honors departments, but UW is a large university with a ton of different classes, so I naturally explored some other fields. Here are a few classes outside of CS and Honors that I want to highlight:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ECON 200: Introduction to Microeconomics</strong>:<br>
        Technically this could be considered too early for this portfolio, but I took this course during the summer immediately after I graduated from high school, before my first quarter as a matriculated student. I wasn't sure what to expect out of a "college-level" course, so it was the only one I signed up for, and that enabled me to really focus in on the content&#8212;I didn't have much else I needed to do at the time. As a result, I ended up doing well in the course despite my fears about the low median grade (I didn't know how much work other people in that class might be putting in), and it was satisfying to be able to commit myself to just one thing and do it well for that summer. Of course, that course and that summer haven't been all that important in the grand scheme of things, but I did have a good time, and some of the simple concepts like supply and demand interactions have been useful in thinking about other things.
