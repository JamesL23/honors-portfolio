<p>
    I probably could have made it through the past four years by taking classes only in the Computer Science and Honors departments, but UW is a large university with a ton of different classes, so I naturally explored some other fields. Here are a few classes outside of CS and Honors that I want to highlight:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ECON 200: Introduction to Microeconomics</strong>:<br>
        Technically this could be considered too early for this portfolio, but I took this course during the summer immediately after I graduated from high school, before my first quarter as a matriculated student. I wasn't sure what to expect out of a "college-level" course, so it was the only one I signed up for, and that enabled me to really focus in on the content&#8212;I didn't have much else I needed to do at the time. As a result, I ended up doing well in the course despite my fears about the low median grade (I didn't know how much work other people in that class might be putting in), and it was satisfying to be able to commit myself to just one thing and do it well for that summer. Of course, that course and that summer haven't been all that important in the grand scheme of things, but I did have a good time, and some of the simple concepts like supply and demand interactions have been useful in thinking about other things.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>MATH 208: Linear Algebra</strong>:<br>
        One of the two true math classes I took during my time at UW. Other math classes include MATH 126, CSE 311, and CSE 312, but I'm not including those here because I already had exposure to the content of MATH 126 from high school, CSE 311 was already on the CS classes page, and I really didn't like CSE 312. I enjoyed linear algebra because learning extremely mechanical calculations composed of simple pieces and trying to figure out what they represented made me feel smart. I also made a fun poster about cryptography (not to be confused with cryptocurrency) with a few classmates, which was fun.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>PHIL 100: Introduction to Philosophy</strong>:<br>
        This was the first philosophy class I took. I decided to take it during Spring 2022 because I was scrolling through the course catalogue for some more credits and it occurred to me that it might be nice to know more about how to think about things. I learned a bit about historical ways of thinking about "things", and I enjoyed it so much that I've been taking a philosophy class every quarter since (though I unfortunately discovered the department too late to complete a minor with the rest of my schedule).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>PHIL 149: Existentialism in Film</strong>:<br>
        I decided to take this class because the previous two philosophy classes I took didn't answer the question of, "Does any of this matter at all?" to my satisfaction. During the quarter, we discussed existential philosophers and interpreted characters from various movies and TV shows with their ideas in mind. I think my only regret about the course is that it wasn't long enough; I really enjoyed learning about various existential philosophies and trying to apply them to my own search for meaning in life. I would have liked to take Dr. Schnee's course the following quarter, Existentialism in Video Games, but I wasn't able to get in without a philosophy major or minor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>DANCE 287: Capoeira</strong>:<br>
        This was another class I took on a whim because I wanted two more credits for the quarter, I was scrolling through the course catalogue, and I remembered hearing about UW's dance classes being fun. I had heard about capoeira (described by Mestre Silvinho as an "Afro-Brazilian martial art with dance elements") before and seen some videos in which it looked really cool, so I decided to try it. I got to try moving around in cool ways that I was too intimidated to try before, and it was generally just fun to have some time to cut loose and try new things a few times a week.
