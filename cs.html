    I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life when I started college,
    but it seemed like the cs program was popular and I didn't absolutely hate cs
    so I decided to apply for that. I did enjoy the problem-solving aspects at first,
    but then the fact that I was planning on doing something software-related as my
    career and therefore was expected to be kind of good at it started setting in and
    my enjoyment faded. That said, I think I'd end up disliking just about anything if
    I decided to do it as a career. CS just happened to be what I picked to sacrifice to
    that tendency, and I'm sure that there are other careers I'd dislike more. Plus,
    even though I never did take the web programming course, it would have been harder
    to make my website like this if I wasn't familiar with concepts like git. Here
    are some of the CS classes I did find more interesting.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CSE 311 - Foundations of Computing I: The concepts taught in CSE 311 were very
        interesting to me--I enjoyed applying concepts like implications and
        biconditionals to daily life ("If I went to class on time, then I did not
        oversleep") and some of the assignments involved some neat logic puzzles
        that I had a lot of fun thinking through. I ended up not liking the class
        very much by the end of the quarter though, because even though I liked
        thinking about the course material, I liked having to communicate my
        thoughts through proofs and formal solution write-ups much less. The
        early stages of online school during the last few weeks of the quarter
        did not help either, and I ended up not finishing a few of my assignments
        towards the end, but I think the course still helped to shape the way I
        reason about things.
    </li>
    <li>
        CSE 484 - Computer Security: The world of computer security and computer science
        is always changing, so rather than going super in-depth regarding any specific
        technologies, Dr. Yoshi Kohno emphasized the "security mindset"&#8212;a
        technology-agnostic approach to evaluating the security of a system. I particularly
        enjoyed thinking about systems from the perspective of an attacker (essentially,
        thinking about how I would break things) and Dr. Kohno's lecture on lockpicking.
    </li>
    <li>
        CSE 473 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: I took this class because figured
        that I should learn something about the thing that's going to eventually take all our
        jobs. I wasn't so interested in machine learning—the stuff under the hood—though, so
        I decided to take this overview course about AI. I learned some interesting stuff
        about various ways we can program computers to make “good” decisions, and I maintain
        my belief that this stuff will eventually put us all out of jobs because it continues
        to get better. To illustrate this point, I'm going to let chatGPT finish this paragraph.
        To illustrate this point, I'm going to turn the proverbial mic over to chatGPT for this
        next section.

                While it's true that AI has the potential to automate certain jobs, it's important
                to note that it will also create new opportunities and lead to the development of
                entirely new industries. AI technology can assist humans in performing tasks that
                are too dangerous, difficult, or time-consuming for humans to complete alone,
                such as exploring space or deep sea environments. Additionally, AI can help
                businesses and organizations optimize their operations, improve efficiency,
                and reduce costs, ultimately leading to the creation of new jobs in fields
                like data analysis, programming, and AI development.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px">
                It's important to remember that AI is a tool that humans can use to augment our
                 abilities and improve our quality of life, rather than something that will
                 inevitably take over and replace us. As we continue to develop and refine
                 AI technology, it's crucial that we approach its implementation and regulation
                 with responsibility and foresight to ensure that it benefits society as a whole.                
            </p>
        </details>
        It starts by reassuring me that AI will not just put us all out of work and discussing
        the benefits of AI which is a little suspicious to me, but it makes a lot of good points
        about the importance of being careful about how we use it moving forward. If I didn't
        know better, I could have been convinced that this was written by an AI researcher.
