    It's not for me, but actually I guess it kind of is?

<p>
    I really wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life when I started college,
    but it seemed like the cs program was popular and I didn't absolutely hate cs
    so I decided to apply for that. I did enjoy the problem-solving aspects at first,
    but then the fact that I was planning on doing something software-related as my
    career and therefore was expected to be kind of good at it started setting in and
    my enjoyment faded. That said, I think I'd end up disliking just about anything if
    I decided to do it as a career, and there are certainly other careers I'd dislike
    more. Here are some of the CS classes I found more interesting.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        CSE 311 - Foundations of Computing I: The concepts taught in CSE 311 were very
        interesting to me--I enjoyed applying concepts like implications and
        biconditionals to daily life ("If I went to class on time, then I did not
        oversleep") and some of the assignments involved some neat logic puzzles
        that I had a lot of fun thinking through. I ended up not liking the class
        very much by the end of the quarter though, because even though I liked
        thinking about the course material, I liked having to communicate my
        thoughts through proofs and formal solution write-ups much less. The
        early stages of online school during the last few weeks of the quarter
        did not help either, and I ended up not finishing a few of my assignments
        towards the end, but I think the course still helped to shape the way I
        reason about things.
    </li>
    <li>
        CSE 484 - Computer Security: The world of computer security and computer science
        is always changing, so rather than going super in-depth regarding any specific
        technologies, Dr. Yoshi Kohno emphasized the "security mindset" &#8212;a
        technology-agnostic approach to evaluating the security of a system. I particularly
        enjoyed thinking about systems from the perspective of an attacker (essentially,
        thinking about how I would break things) and Dr. Kohno's lecture on lockpicking.
