I've had a weird relationship with career plans. I used to not know what I wanted to do; I very clearly remember doing an assignment about what I wanted to be when I was an elementary school and writing "When I grow up I want to be a helper of every job" because a lot of things seemed pretty neat to me. That decision was later more or less made for me when I got accepted to the CS program at UW. Fortunately, my experience with the industry itself (outside of applying to jobs&#8212;but I'm pretty sure that part is universally a pain in the ass) hasn't left me with too many complaints too far.
<h4>Ghost Pacer</h4>
I spent a summer working with <a href="https://ghostpacer.com/">Ghost Pacer</a>, a startup one of my friends was working on with the goal of making augmented reality glasses for runners, and then ended up taking a quarter off to continue working with them. It was cool that I got to have some independence and control over what I was doing and try new things; for instance, one of my projects early on was to make animated graphics in Unity to use in our Kickstarter promotional materials. I also got some experience working with technologies like Apple WatchOS and Bluetooth Low Energy transmission, which was all very exciting.<br>

Working with the startup was fun, but not without its own drawbacks. Startups tend to be on the smaller end as far as companies are concerned, and Ghost Pacer was no exception. This meant that while I had more independence with my work, it seemed often that there was less margin for error than a larger company might have&#8212;I could be <em>the</em> most experienced person with a given technology working there at a given moment, and if I couldn't figure the thing out then there was going to be a problem.<br>
I also had a lot of trouble negotiating salary with my boss, because he was also my good friend. I typically have no qualms about asking for what I'm owed, but I was completely unable to separate AbdurRahman Bhatti, my friend from AbdurRahman Bhatti, CEO of Ghost Pacer. It also didn't help that he asked me what I wanted to be paid instead of proposing a rate&#8212;it felt like I'd be imposing on him the more I asked for (which was only a problem because we had already been friends for years without the business context), and I ended up paying myself well below the average rate for an undergraduate software engineering intern. This tendency to struggle with mixing business and friendship is something I know about myself now, so in general I'm a little more hesitant to work directly under people I know now.
<h4>T-Mobile</h4>
During my freshman year, I randomly decided to go to a networking event where college students could meet software industry mentors and ended up meeting Jenny Phillips, a product manager at T-Mobile. Jenny ended up helping me to get an internship at T-Mobile the following year, where I got some experience working in software for a larger company. I ended up also returning to T-Mobile for another internship the following summer, and I developed a sense of how I might fit in as an individual developer at a large company. My post-graduation return offer ended up falling through due to the tech economy exploding, but I guess that's just how life is sometimes.<br>
Here are my internship presentations for each summer with more details on what I was working on:<br>
