<marquee>Learning Statement
    My past few years at UW have been a time of growth. The path I have taken hasn’t always been what I expected, but through those experiences I have grown as a person. I have improved my skills and knowledge in a variety of different fields and developed my outlook on life, and I believe the skills I have learned at UW will allow me to continue learning for the rest of my life.
    
    I would consider getting better at things a core part of any sort of education, and that has undeniably happened for me at UW. Though it doesn’t always feel like it, I am certainly more knowledgeable in my major, computer science, than I was when I entered UW. Through other classes, I have also learned about other topics such as economics and climate change. Recently, I have taken a particular interest in philosophy classes. While I will not have enough time to take on a philosophy minor, I plan to use the knowledge and interest in philosophy I have developed to continue learning about it after graduation regardless.
    
    Outside of classes, I have also made friends and gotten better at living independently. Being able to make my own choices and do whatever I want pushed me to think more about what exactly I do want. I used to think in high school that I wanted nothing more than to sit around, eat good food, and play video games all day. Certainly, a part of me would still like that, but it also seems that there is more to life than that. My time at UW has shown me the joys of interacting with others and improving my own skills and knowledge. All the same, I plan on having a long life ahead of me, and I am sure those goals will also continue to change over time.
