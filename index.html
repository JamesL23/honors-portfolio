<p>
    When I first entered UW as a computer science student, my general plan for
    the next few years was to do exactly what we were advised not to do at
    orientation: do OK in my CS classes, ignore everything else, and be fed
    directly into a high-paying tech job, essentially treating the program as a
    sort of white-collar trade school. This plan did not work out for several 
    reasons. I disliked a good chunk of my CS classes a lot&#8212;especially while I
    was taking them online&#8212;didn't do super well in them, and ended up taking
    more interest in the various other classes I explored. Rather than staying
    completely isolated, I naturally found some people with common interests and
    became friends with them. My internship return offer fell through and landscape
    of software jobs is a mess with just a few months left until I graduate, so I
    haven't secured the tech job either. But though things didn't go according to
    plan, I'm not too worried about the future. My tech experience is, at the very
    least, passable, and I am confident in my ability to pick up and refresh my
    skills as needed.

    Lame tech job talk aside, I've had plenty of great experiences during my last
    4 years at UW. I got involved with one of UW's Super Smash Bros. RSOs, tried
    my hand at some Human-Computer Interaction research, pondered my existence in
    various UW philosophy classes, picked up the guitar, and took on a plate of
    spicy wings at Wing Dome's 7-Alarm Challenge with my housemates. It might
    seem silly to group these activities together as important formative college
    experiences, but the last four years have been a time for me to try things
    outâ€”to varying degrees of success. Continue reading my portfolio to learn more!
